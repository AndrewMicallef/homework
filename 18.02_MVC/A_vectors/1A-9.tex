\problem{Prove using vector methods (without components) that the line
segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel
to the third side and half its length. (Call the two sides $\vec{A}$
and $\vec{B}$.)}

Take the triangle formed by the vectors $\vec{A}$, $\vec{B}$, and $
\vec{C}$, where
\begin{equation*}
\vec{A} + \vec{B} = \vec{C}
\end{equation*}

The midpoints sides $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ are the vectors
$\frac{1}{2}\vec{A}$, and $\frac{1}{2}\vec{B}$ respectivley.
The line segment joining these points can be expressed as a vector,

\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2}\vec{A} + \frac{1}{2}\vec{B}
\end{equation*}

This is the same as
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2} (\vec{A} + \vec{B})
\end{equation*}

And because we know that $\vec{A} + \vec{B} = \vec{C}$, we therefore
have
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2} (\vec{A} + \vec{B}) =  \frac{1}{2} \vec{C}
\end{equation*}


Thus the line joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle are
parrallel to, and half the length of the third side
