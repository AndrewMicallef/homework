\problem{A small plane wishes to fly due north at 200 mph (as seen from
the ground), in a wind blowing from the north east at 50 mph. Tell with
what vector velocity in the air it should travel (give the $i\ j$-
components).}

Lets say that due north is the $j$ direction, namely $<0,1>$,
because that lines up with the image I have for the y-axis, and
thus, east is in the direction of $i$, $<1,0>$.
Our target is a vector $T = <0, 200> = (0\bi + 200\bj)$.
The windspeed, $|\vec{W})|$ is 50 mph, and has a direction $\hat{\vec
{W}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(i + j)$
Thus our heading velocity $\vec{V}$ ought to be $\vec{T} - \vec{W}$

\begin{align}
\vec{V} &= \vec{T} - \vec{W}\\
&= 200\bj - \frac{50}{\sqrt{2}}(i+j)\\
&= (- \frac{50}{\sqrt{2}}i + (200  - \frac{50}{\sqrt{2}}) \bj)\\
\therefore \vec{V} &\approx (- 35.4 \bi + 164.6 \bj)\ \text{mph}
\end{align}
